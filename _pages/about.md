## **About me**
I am a DPhil in the statistics department at the University of Oxford (Computational Discovery CDT), and my supervisors are Prof. Mihai Cucuringu and Prof. Xiaowen Dong. Prior to that, I received my MASc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of British Columbia, and BSc in Physics from Nankai University.

## **Research**
My research interest lies in the intersection of statistics and computation. Currently, I am focusing on better understanding computational tasks on graphs using tools such as probability theory, statistics, spectral methods, optimization, etc. My research involves proposing data-driven algorithms together with mathematical proofs, and at the same time, I seek to understand the nature of the problems and algorithms through the lens of those proofs. I am excited to see the transformation of ideas across different research fields.
